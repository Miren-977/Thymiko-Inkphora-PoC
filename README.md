# 🌱 Thymiko – Inkphora (PoC)

**Draw → Interpret → Poetic Line + Heuristic Mood Graphic → Pick Music**  
This live demo shows the core experience: sketch freely, receive a short AI-generated poetic line with a small **heuristic mood graphic** (demo visualization), then explore a music path.

## 🎨 How it works
1. Draw a few strokes on the canvas.  
2. Click **Interpret** (below the sketchpad).  
3. Read the poetic AI response + **heuristic mood graphic** (demo visualization, not an assessment).  
4. Pick one of the three suggested music links.
